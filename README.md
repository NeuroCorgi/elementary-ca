# Elementary cellular automata

Simple emacs mode for emacs to simulate elementary automata.

## Description

Initial conditions can be set with `ca-make-white` and `ca-make-black` on the first row of the buffer.
Command `ca-set-rule` will change the rule, and, therefore, regenerate all generations from the given initial conditions.
